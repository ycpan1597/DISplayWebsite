			<h2>Mission</h2>
			<p>
			Our team's goal is to create a collaborative play environment for all kids, including individuals with physical and mental disabilities. We accomodate their needs by using our engineering expertise to ensure that they can have just as much as others.

			<h2>Progress as of December, 2017</h2>
			<p>On 11/29, our team gathered to try out the smoke generator that Amy brought in to test if we could see a laser beam under natural lighting. The result was great! Everyone could see the beam clearly, as shown in some photos, and the mirrors Joe brought also worked better than expected, reflecting laser beams at very precise angle with no blurring at all.</p>
			<p>Joe also brought in some toys, which were used to estimate the optimal obstacle size. We all had fun arranging them onto the platform!</p>

			<h2>Fall Design Review - Decembber 14, 2017</h2>
			<p>The fall design review that happened on 12/14 was an opportunity for students to present their current progress with a poster to the community members and need experts who have helped us along the way. The event was a great success for our team, as we gathered a lot of useful feedback from the audience. It was also great to see just how excited people are about our project! The demo of the accessible modular switch went great and everyone on the team feels very excited to make more prototypes next quarter!</p>
