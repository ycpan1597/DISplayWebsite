				Hi all, I joined HuskyADAPT because I wanted to learn valuable, out-of-classroom skills and apply what I know to improve

				Iâ€™m a  junior in Human Centered Design and Engineering in the University of Washington. 
				I am an aspiring UX designer in the tech and media industry where I want to help create an enjoyable user experience. Originally from Tokyo Japan now in Seattle. I believe that every child has a right to play without facing barriers by their abilities. Through this project I hope we can provide a space that all children can feel included without feeling left behind.
