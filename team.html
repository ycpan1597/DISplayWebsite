				<h3>UW Bioengineering, class of 2019</h3>
				<p class="memberContent">
					I'm currently a junior studying BIOE at University of Washington. Originally from Taiwan, I immigrated to America at the age of 15 in pursuit of 
					a more well-rounded education. I joined HuskyADAPT because I wanted to learn valuable, out-of-classroom skills and apply what I know to improve
					the well-being of individuals with disabilities. I enjoy playing badminton and listening to music during my free time.

					Iâ€™m a  junior in Human Centered Design and Engineering in the University of Washington. 
					I am an aspiring UX designer in the tech and media industry where I want to help create an enjoyable user experience. Originally from Tokyo Japan now in Seattle. I believe that every child has a right to play without facing barriers by their abilities. Through this project I hope we can provide a space that all children can feel included without feeling left behind.
