				<h2>Preston Pan</h2>
				<h3>UW Bioengineering, class of 2019</h3>
				<p class="memberContent">
					I'm currently a junior studying BIOE at University of Washington. Originally from Taiwan, I immigrated to America at the age of 15 in pursuit of a more well-rounded education. I joined HuskyADAPT because I wanted to learn valuable, out-of-classroom skills and apply what I know to improve the well-being of individuals with disabilities. I enjoy playing badminton and listening to music during my free time.

				<h2>Joe Lawler</h2>
				<h3>UW Mechanical Engineering, class of 2020</h3>
				<p class="memberContent">
					I am a sophomore studying the Mechanical Engineering here at the University of Washington. I have loved working with people with disabilities since middle school and it is something that I am incredibly passionate about. I am also a geek about math and physics but considered these two passions completely unrelated. Husky ADAPT has given me the opportunity to pursue both passions and help others at the same time.
